## Elementary Rules of Usage

1. **(Peter's. Charles's) Use 's for possessive singular of nouns.** Exceptions are ancient proper names and pronominal prossessives hers, its, theirs, yours, and oneself. 
2. **(Apple, Banana, and Chiku) For series of terms with conjunction, use comma after the terms except for the last.** etc. is always preceeded by a comma.
3. **(This dude, who was indifferent, became more interested) Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas.** Applies to non-restrictive clauses introduced by which, when, where, who. Restrictive relative clauses do not require the commas (The dude who is most interested will get the position).
4. **(Something something happened, but another thing also happened) Place a comma before introducing an independent clause**
5. **(This dude is cool; he was a former ninja) Do not join independent clauses by a comma.** Use a semicolon to form a compound sentence if necessary.
6. **(This is. An apple) Do NOT break sentences in two**
7. **(Being in a dilapitated condition, the house was a bargain for me) Participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence MUST refer to the grammatical subject (the house).** The counter example: Being in a dilapitated condition, I was able to buy the house cheap. (I became dilapitated LOL).
8. **Wrap words getting cut of at the end of line to the next line by dividing it according to formation (know-ledge), or on vowel (propo-sition), or on double letters (refer-ring) unless they form a simple word (tell-ing).**

## Elementary Principles of Composition

9. **Paragraph is the unit of composition. One paragraph per topic.** Single sentences should not be a paragraph. In diaglogue, each speech is a paragraph by itself.
10. **(To achieve this, must do that. Blah blah reasons. And so again emphasise that must do that to ahieve this) Begin each paragraph with a topic sentence; end it in conformity with the beginning.** In the body of the paragraph, you may include: 
  > - topic sentence clarified by denial of the contrary, 
  > - repeated topic sentence in abridged form, 
  > - topic sentence made clearer, 
  > - definition expanded,
  > - definition explained by contrast,
  > - and supporting reasons.
11. **(I shall backup the database) Use active voice which is more direct and vigorous than the passive.** The counter example: The task of database backup shall be undertaken by me (LOL at all those workplace emails).
12. **(His performance is not below average) Put statements in positive form.** The right way: His performance is average.
13. **(the question as to whether == whether) Omit needless words.**
14. **Avoid a succession of loose sentences.** If you find a series of sentences monotonous (mechanical, symmetrical), mix them up with
  > - simple sentences,
  > - sentences of two clauses joined by semicolon,
  > - periodic sentences of two clauses,
  > - sentences, loose or periodic, of three clauses.
15. **(Roses are red; violets are blue) Express co-ordinate ideas in similar form.** The counter example: Roses are red. Blue violets. Same rule applies to correlative expressions: both-and / not-but / not only-but also / either-or / first-second-third / -and the like.
16. **(Dude, in the middle of a quest, pulled a meme) Keep related words together.** The right way: In the middle of a quest, dude pulled a meme.
17. **Use a single tense in summaries, preferably present tense.** 
  > Regardless of choice, be consistent. 
  > If present tense is chosen, antecedent action should be expressed by the perfect tense (e.g. this dude has completed something, instead of this dude completed something). 
  > Past tense in indirect discourse remains past tense. 
  > Make clear at the start of the summary that what follows are thoughts or expressions of the author to prevent repeating notification.
18. **(Dude is the carry of his team, because he is good at lane farming) Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end.** The right way: Because of his good lane farming skills, dude is the carry of his team. As a rule of thumb, put the punch at the end. This applies to words in a sentence, sentences in a paragraph, paragraphs in a composition.

## Matters of Form

- **Headings.** Leave a line after. Succeeding pages can start on line 1.
- **Numerals.** Do not spell out dates or serial numbers.
- **Parentheses.** Sentence containing the parenthesis is punctuated on the outside, as if the inserted expression do not exist. Expressions in the parentheses has its own punctuations.
- **Quotations.** 
  > Citing documentary evidence are introduced by a colon. 
  > Quotes in apposition or the direct objects of verbs are introduced by a comma. 
  > 
  > Quotes of entire line should begin on a fresh line, and centered, but NOT enclosed in quotation marks. 
  > Quotes following keyword **that** do not need quotation marks. 
  > Proverbial expressions and familiar phrases of literary origin, colloquialisms and slang do not require quotation marks.
- **References.** Abbreviate titles that occur frequently, giving full forms in an alphabetical list at the end. Give references in parenthesis or footnotes.
- **Titles.** Prefers italics with capitalised initials. Omit initial "A" or "The" if you placed the possessive before them (e.g. *The Assasin's Creed* or Ubisoft's *Assasin's Creed*).

## Words and Expressions Commonly Misused

- **All right.** Always two words. May be replaced with "Agreed" or "Go ahead".
- **As to whether.** Replace with "Whether".

- **Certainly.** Avoid.
- **Character.** similar usage to "nature", is often unnecessary.
- **Claim.** E.g. claimed to be. Not to substitute for "Declare", "Maintain", or "Charge".
- **Compare.**

  > Compare with == point out differences between objects regarded as of the same order.
- **Consider**
