### Foreword

> Silicon Valley would be a much better place for both managers and engineers if people embraced "working smart" rather than "working hard".

### Introduction
Effectiveness is determined by both time taken and value produced. An effective engineer produces high value in a short time.

# Adopt the Right Mindset

### Focus on High-Leverage Activities
Leverage = Impact Produced / Time Invested

High leverage activities meant that you will enjoy high ROI for your time and effort. This idea resembles the Pareto Principle (80-20 rule).

**Use Leverage as Your Yardstick for Effectiveness**

For engineers, focusing on onboarding and mentoring programs to ensure new hires start off on the right foundation greatly improves the code quality and productivity of the entire team. These are two of the highest leverage activities that any engineering teams can do.

**Increase Your Leverage In Three Ways**

1. Reduce time taken to complete certain tasks.
2. Increase output of certain tasks.
3. Transition to higher leverage activities.

For every actvity you perform, ask yourself if any or all of the three improvements can be applied.

**Direct Energy towards Leverage Points, not just Easy Wins**

Resources are never sufficient. Adopt habits that produce disproportionately high impact for any time spent.

### Optimize for Learning
Optimizing for learning is a high-leverage activity for an effective engineer.

**Adopt a Growth Mindset**

Standford psychologist Carol Dweck found that people adopt one of two mindsets. I find her idea similar to the nature vs nurture debate.

- Fixed mindset individuals
	- believe that abilities are inherent
	- believe that failure indicates that they are not talented
	- tend to stick to activitie they perform well to validate their intelligence
	- tend to give up early or easily, which enables them to point to a lack of effort rather than a lack of ability
- Growth mindset individuals
	- believe that abilities can be cultivated through effort
	- believe that they lack aptitudes in certain areas
	- tend to view challenges and failures as opportunities to learn
	- less likely to give up on their path to success

Tamar Bercovici, enginnering manager at Box:

> It's not about apologizing for where your resume doesn't line up but rather telling your story - who you are, what skills you've built, what you're excited about doing next and why

To be effective, take control of your own story, optimizing for experiences where you learn rather than experiences where you effortlessly succeed.

**Invest in Your Rate of Learning**

1. Learning follows an exponential growth curve. Strong foundation enables you to gain more knowledge faster in future.
2. The earlier you start, the more time your learning has to compound.
3. Due to compounding, small deltas in your learning rate make a big difference in the long run.

Stephen Cohen, co-founder of Palantir:

> When companies pay you for cushy and unchallenging 9-to-5 jobs, they are actually paying you to accept a much lower intellectual growth rate. When you recognize that intelligence is compounding, the cost of missing long-term compounding is enormous.

**Seek Work Environment Conducive to Learning**

Since you will be spending a lot of time at work, choose a work environment that promotes sustainable learning at both personal and professional level, using these criteria:

1. Fast Growth - ample opportunities to make big impact and increase your responsibilities creates an environment that attracts strong talent, which generate a feedback to even faster growth. Environment that lacks growth leads to stagnation, politics and loss of talent.
2. Training - effective teams recognise the importance of onboarding and mentorship. See the [earlier section.](#focus-on-high-leverage-activities)
3. Openness - a culture that share feedback and information proactively, reflecting on failures and internalising lessons learnt.
4. Pace - iterating quickly provides faster feedback cycle and enables you to learn faster. Bureaucracy usually kills speed. However do find a sustainable pace and avoid burn out.
5. People - working with people who are better than you means you will have better mentors and teachers. Your teammates can matter more than your actual job scope.
6. Autonomy - freedom to choose what and how to work drives learning. Smaller companies usually provide more diverse learning opportunities.

A full set of questions can be found in the same section of the book, for you to ask your hiring manager at the next job interview. At different stage of your career, some criteria may weigh more than others.

**Dedicate Time on the Job to Develop New Skills**

Spend around 20% of your working time to develop new skills. Either gain a deeper understanding in an area you already know, or an adjacent discipline. Here are some suggestions:

1. Study code for core abstractions written by the best engineers - open source projects would work too.
2. Write more code - hands-on practice reinforces learning.
3. Learn from technical or educational materials - codelabs, tech talks, MOOCs etc.
4. Master programming languages that you use.
5. Send your code reviews to the harshest critics.
6. Voluntarily participate in design discussions of projects that interests you.
7. Work on a diversity of projects - interleaved practice is more effective and helps you appreciate problems common in all projects.
8. Work with senior engineers and learn from them.
9. Dive into codes you don't know.

**Always Be Learning**

Here are some other points to cultivate a habit of learning outside of work:

1. Learn new programming languages and frameworks.
2. Learn skills that are in high market demand.
3. Read books - the author can read 1-2 books a week. That is insanely fast.
4. Join a discussion group - a club of mutual improvement.
5. Attend talks, conferences, and meetups.
6. Build and maintain a strong network of relationships - meeting large number of people in your daily lives dramatically increases your chance of getting lucky.
7. Follow bloggers who teach.
8. Write to teach.
9. Tinker on side projects.
10. Pursue what you love.

### Prioritize Regularly
Prioritising regularly is a most highly leveraging activity as it determines the amount of leverage for the rest of your time.

**Track To-Dos in a Single, Easily Accessible List**

Convenience will encourage yourself to use the to-do list. The list helps to prevent tasks from falling through the cracks.

**Focus on What Directly Produces Value**

- Make pairwise comparison between items on the to-do list and prioritise those that directly produces value.
- After which prioritise those that creates the most impact.
- Showing that you have delivered high impact helps you get away with dodging unnecessary meetings, emails, non-urgent bugs etc.
- Learn to say "No" to people who are not respecting the opportunity cost of your time.

**Focus on the Important and Non-Urgent**

- All tasks can be mapped on a graph with 2 axis, Urgency and Importancy.
- We often neglect non-urgent tasks even though they may be important.
- Prioritising important but non-urgent tasks (which are usually planning and strategic in nature) can prevent important and urgent tasks, which are usually crisis, from happening.
- Label all to-dos in the list with Importance and Urgency indicator.

**Protect Your Maker's Schedule**

Reduce context switching. Preserve larger blocks of time in your schedule to focus deeply on your task so that you can be more productive when you are free from interruption. To produce good quality engineering work requires this.

**Limit the Amount of Work In Progress**

Competing priorities divide your time and effort, which slows down the momentum of all concurrent activities. Try to get your tasks done by focusing on a subset of activities first instead of hanging everything at work-in-progress.

**Fight Procrastination with If-Then Plans**

```
if (certain condition is met) 
then (do something)
```
Adopting this plan helps you overcome the inertia of putting off tasks, helps you expend the activation energy required to start a task (which is usually all in the mind, to plan the task), and capture small gaps of free time in your schedule to channel them to more productive tasks.

**Make Routine Prioritization**

A myriad of workflow systems are available. Find that suits your needs. The author is personally using Asana, with a workflow that performs a weekly review of tasks and plans out the following week. Daily milestones and minor adjustments are made every morning. The actual to-do list incorporates all the tips mentioned in this section.

### Invest in Iteration Speed

**Move Fast to Learn Fast**

- iterate faster allows you to identify what works and what doesn't earlier.
- iterating fast actually reduces risk as teams can focus on smaller batches of changes and pinpoint problems faster.

**Invest in Time-Saving**
