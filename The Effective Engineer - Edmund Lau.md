### Introduction
Effectiveness is determined by both time taken and value produced. An effective engineer produces high value in a short time.

# Adopt the Right Mindset

### Focus on High-Leverage Activities
Leverage = Impact Produced / Time Invested

High leverage activities meant that you will enjoy high ROI for your time and effort. This idea resembles the Pareto Principle (80-20 rule).

**Use Leverage as Your Yardstick for Effectiveness**

For engineers, focusing on onboarding and mentoring programs to ensure new hires start off on the right foundation greatly improves the code quality and productivity of the entire team. These are two of the highest leverage activities that any engineering teams can do.

**Increase Your Leverage In Three Ways**

1. Reduce time taken to complete certain tasks.
2. Increase output of certain tasks.
3. Transition to higher leverage activities.

For every actvity you perform, ask yourself if any or all of the three improvements can be applied.

**Direct Energy towards Leverage Points, not just Easy Wins**

Resources are never sufficient. Adopt habits that produce disproportionately high impact for any time spent.

### Optimize for Learning
Optimizing for learning is a high-leverage activity for an effective engineer.

**Adopt a Growth Mindset**

Standford psychologist Carol Dweck found that people adopt one of two mindsets. I find her idea similar to the nature vs nurture debate.

- Fixed mindset individuals
	- believe that abilities are inherent
	- believe that failure indicates that they are not talented
	- tend to stick to activitie they perform well to validate their intelligence
	- tend to give up early or easily, which enables them to point to a lack of effort rather than a lack of ability
- Growth mindset individuals
	- believe that abilities can be cultivated through effort
	- believe that they lack aptitudes in certain areas
	- tend to view challenges and failures as opportunities to learn
	- less likely to give up on their path to success

Tamar Bercovici, enginnering manager at Box:

> It's not about apologizing for where your resume doesn't line up but rather telling your story - who you are, what skills you've built, what you're excited about doing next and why

To be effective, take control of your own story, optimizing for experiences where you learn rather than experiences where you effortlessly succeed.

**Invest in Your Rate of Learning**

1. Learning follows an exponential growth curve. Strong foundation enables you to gain more knowledge faster in future.
2. The earlier you start, the more time your learning has to compound.
3. Due to compounding, small deltas in your learning rate make a big difference in the long run.

Stephen Cohen, co-founder of Palantir:

> When companies pay you for cushy and unchallenging 9-to-5 jobs, they are actually paying you to accept a much lower intellectual growth rate. When you recognize that intelligence is compounding, the cost of missing long-term compounding is enormous.

**Seek Work Environment Conducive to Learning**

Since you will be spending a lot of time at work, choose a work environment that promotes sustainable learning at both personal and professional level, using these criteria:

1. Fast Growth - ample opportunities to make big impact and increase your responsibilities creates an environment that attracts strong talent, which generate a feedback to even faster growth. Environment that lacks growth leads to stagnation, politics and loss of talent.
2. Training - effective teams recognise the importance of onboarding and mentorship. See the [earlier section.](#focus-on-high-leverage-activities)
3. Openness - a culture that share feedback and information proactively, reflecting on failures and internalising lessons learnt.
4. Pace - iterating quickly provides faster feedback cycle and enables you to learn faster. Bureaucracy usually kills speed. However do find a sustainable pace and avoid burn out.
5. People - working with people who are better than you means you will have better mentors and teachers. Your teammates can matter more than your actual job scope.
6. Autonomy - freedom to choose what and how to work drives learning. Smaller companies usually provide more diverse learning opportunities.

A full set of questions can be found in the same section of the book, for you to ask your hiring manager at the next job interview. At different stage of your career, some criteria may weigh more than others.

**Dedicate Time on the Job to Develop New Skills**

Spend around 20% of your working time to develop new skills. Either gain a deeper understanding in an area you already know, or an adjacent discipline. Here are some suggestions:

1. Study code for core abstractions written by the best engineers - open source projects would work too.
2. Write more code - hands-on practice reinforces learning.
3. Learn from technical or educational materials - codelabs, tech talks, MOOCs etc.
4. Master programming languages that you use.
5. Send your code reviews to the harshest critics.
6. Voluntarily participate in design discussions of projects that interests you.
7. Work on a diversity of projects - interleaved practice is more effective and helps you appreciate problems common in all projects.
8. Work with senior engineers and learn from them.
9. Dive into codes you don't know.

**Always Be Learning**

Here are some other points to cultivate a habit of learning outside of work:

1. Learn new programming languages and frameworks.
2. Learn skills that are in high market demand.
3. Read books - the author can read 1-2 books a week. That is insanely fast.
4. Join a discussion group - a club of mutual improvement.
5. Attend talks, conferences, and meetups.
6. Build and maintain a strong network of relationships - meeting large number of people in your daily lives dramatically increases your chance of getting lucky.
7. Follow bloggers who teach.
8. Write to teach.
9. Tinker on side projects.
10. Pursue what you love.

### Prioritize Regularly
Prioritising regularly is a most highly leveraging activity as it determines the amount of leverage for the rest of your time.

**Track To-Dos in a Single, Easily Accessible List**

Convenience will encourage yourself to use the to-do list. The list helps to prevent tasks from falling through the cracks.

**Focus on What Directly Produces Value**

- Make pairwise comparison between items on the to-do list and prioritise those that directly produces value.
- After which prioritise those that creates the most impact.
- Showing that you have delivered high impact helps you get away with dodging unnecessary meetings, emails, non-urgent bugs etc.
- Learn to say "No" to people who are not respecting the opportunity cost of your time.

**Focus on the Important and Non-Urgent**

- All tasks can be mapped on a graph with 2 axis, Urgency and Importancy.
- We often neglect non-urgent tasks even though they may be important.
- Prioritising important but non-urgent tasks (which are usually planning and strategic in nature) can prevent important and urgent tasks, which are usually crisis, from happening.
- Label all to-dos in the list with Importance and Urgency indicator.

**Protect Your Maker's Schedule**

Reduce context switching. Preserve larger blocks of time in your schedule to focus deeply on your task so that you can be more productive when you are free from interruption. To produce good quality engineering work requires this.

**Limit the Amount of Work In Progress**

Competing priorities divide your time and effort, which slows down the momentum of all concurrent activities. Try to get your tasks done by focusing on a subset of activities first instead of hanging everything at work-in-progress.

**Fight Procrastination with If-Then Plans**

```
if (certain condition is met) 
then (do something)
```
Adopting this plan helps you overcome the inertia of putting off tasks, helps you expend the activation energy required to start a task (which is usually all in the mind, to plan the task), and capture small gaps of free time in your schedule to channel them to more productive tasks.

**Make Routine Prioritization**

A myriad of workflow systems are available. Find that suits your needs. The author is personally using Asana, with a workflow that performs a weekly review of tasks and plans out the following week. Daily milestones and minor adjustments are made every morning. The actual to-do list incorporates all the tips mentioned in this section.

# Execution

### Invest in Iteration Speed

**Move Fast to Learn Fast**

- iterate faster allows you to identify what works and what doesn't earlier.
- iterating fast actually reduces risk as teams can focus on smaller batches of changes and pinpoint problems faster.

**Invest in Time-Saving**

The book talks about improving DevOps process in general using tools.

Raffi Krikorian, VP of Platform Engineering:

> If you have to do something manually more than twice, then write a tool for the third time

Faster tools get used more often, further increasing leverage. Faster tools also unlock new development workflows that were previously not possible. Some ideas mentioned for you to consider:

- Shorten compile time. This encourages shorter iteration.
- Interactive programming environment. Read-eval-print loop (REPL) is faster than Edit-compile-run-debug loop, which is why Scala and Clojure is faster to develop than Java even though all of them uses the JVM.
- Hot code reload. Application runs updated code without full restart.
- Continuous integration. Every commit triggers building of codebase and running the entire test suite, speeding up debugging.
- Promote adoption of productivity tool in the team to multiply the leverage gained by every team member.
- Lower the effort of switching tool to increase adoption.
- Start small. Small success empowers you to build bigger tools in future.

**Shorten Your Debugging and Validation Loops**

Instead of running through the normal steps to trigger a state in the software for debugging, shorten it by creating workflow to immediately run the software in the desired state. This saves debugging time in the long run, and will provide further leverage if you integrate the workflow into a test suite.

**Master Your Programming Environment**

Programming environment do not change drastically. Mastering the standard tools used for all developments is a worthwhile investment.

- Get proficient with your preferred text editor/IDE.
- Learn at least one productive, high-level programming language.
- Get familiar with UNIX/Windows shell commands.
- Prefer keyboard over mouse.
- Automate manual workflow.
- Make it fast and simple to run unit tests with the current changes.

**Don't Ignore Your Non-Engineering Bottlenecks**

1. People bottleneck - you are waiting for dependencies to be delivered by another team or person. Constant and over communication helps. In the most extreme case, undertake the development of dependencies to take full control.
2. Decision making bottleneck - get buy-in from key decision maker early, before heavily investing your development. Constantly communicate your ideas to them, and understand their priorities to align your project.
3. Review process bottleneck - plan ahead, communicate and coordinate with teams involved to smoothen the process.

Some bottlenecks may be outside your sphere of influence. Just do your best to optimise the biggest bottleneck within your control.

### Measure What You Want to Improve
Having a good metric to quantify user happiness is important. Example given in the book for Google Search's succss is using long click (duration user spent on the linked page before returning to the search result page) as a measure for user satisfaction with the search results.

**Use Metrics to Drive Progress**

1. Good metrics help you focus on the important features that meet your objectives, and those with highest leverage.
2. Tracking metrics over time guard against future regressions.
3. Good metric drives forward progress. Setting a ratchet on the metric ensure that updates that worsen the metric cannot be deployed until another improvement counterbalances the change.

**Pick the Right Metric to Incentivize the Behaviour You Want**

A good metric guides our decisions and focus to high leverage activities. A poor metric is counter productive and incentivise bad behaviour. Choose a metric that:

- *maximise impact*. something focused on the most important aspect of your product, unified across all teams.
- is *actionable*. can be related directly back to engineering changes made by the team.
- is *responsive yet robust*. responds to changes quickly yet does not pick up much noise.

**Instrument Everything to Understand What's Going On**

- The previous section talks about high level goals and metrics the entire team should be focused on.
- This section talks about measuring operational metrics for the teams to understand how they are running.

Engineering team at Etsy:

> Measure anything. Measure Everything.

A lot of insights are gathered through exploratory data analysis. Having dashboards, tools, and instruments to measure operations is essential to help achieve the main over arching goals mentioned in the previous secions. If not, everyone is just flying blind.

**Internalize Useful Numbers**

Jeff Dean, Googler, recommends the following latency numbers to keep in mind:

| Access Type | Latency |
| --- | --- |
| L1 Cache Ref | 0.5 ns |
| Branch Mispredict | 5 ns |
| L2 Cache Ref | 7 ns |
| Mutex lock/unlock | 100 ns |
| Main Memory Ref | 100 ns |
| Compress 1KB w Snappy | 10 microsec |
| Send 2KB over 1Gbps network | 20 microsec |
| Read 1MB sequentially from memory | 250 microsec |
| RTT within same datacenter | 500 microsec |
| Disk seek | 10 ms |
| Read 1MB sequentially from network | 10 ms |
| Read 1MB sequentially from disk | 30 ms |
| Send packet from CA to Netherlands to CA | 150 ms |

On top of these, which may not be relevant to you, there are other quick numbers more specific to your products/business that you should know, such as industry benchmarks.

- number of users, weekly and monthly active, sign up etc.
- number of requests per second.
- amount and total capacity of data stored.
- amount of data written and accessed daily.
- number of servers needed per certain number of services.
- throughput of services/endpoints.
- growth rate of traffic.
- average page load time.
- distribution of traffic across different parts of product.
- distribution of traffic across devices, browsers, OS, regions etc.

In conclusion:

- Knowing such key figures enables you to do preliminary evaluation of designs without actually building it.
- You can also quickly spot anomalies in related data measurements.
- Helps to clarify areas and scopes of improvements.
- if necessary, build simple tools to profile performance and gather these numbers.

**Be Skeptical about Data Integrity**

Untrustworthy and wrong data that gets incorporated into decision making processes creates negative leverage. Engineers tend to neglect metrics data integrity because:

1. in the face of deadlines, measuring metrics has a lower priority.
2. it is easier to validate features than to verify metrics data.
3. of an assumption that since the feature code that generate the metrics are well tested, the data integrity should be guaranteed.

Strategies you can consider:

- log data liberally in case it is needed in future.
- build tools to iterate on data accuracy sooner.
- write end-to-end integration tests to validate your entire analytics pipeline.
- examine collected data sooner.
- cross validate data accuracy by computing the same metric in multiple ways.
- when a number looks off, investigate early.

### Validate Your Ideas Early and Often
Faster iteration helps us get more things done. Frequent validation helps us get the right things done.

**Find Low-Effort Ways to Validate Your Work**

Invest a small amount of work to gather data to validate your project assumptions and goals in order to save a lot more wasted effort in the long run.

- Dropbox used a video to showcase the target app behaviour to measure user interest, without building an actual prototype.
- 42Floors used mock up pages in their site to test out 8 different designs with users and only select the winning design for production.
- Asana created a sign up form button to gather user clicks response before deciding to implement sign up feature.

**Continuously Validate Product Changes with A/B Testing**

A/B test feeds a random subset of users a change or a new feature while the rest of the users act as the control group.

- perform on a number of features to find out the best variation.
- quantify how much better is one variation compared to another.
- encourages iterative approach to development.
- if building an A/B testing framework is not feasible, consider open source or commercial tools.

**Beware the One-Person Team**

Working alone runs the risk of getting blindsided by design flaws that surface too late, jeopardising entire project. Working in a team also improves morale and sustain momentum. Try the following strategies for a start:

- be open and receptive to feedbacks.
- commit code early and often.
- request code review from thorough critics.
- ask to bounce ideas off your teammates.
- design the interface or API of a new system first.
- send out design document first before you start coding.
- structure ongoing projects so that there is some shared context with your teammates. this promotes collaboration and sharing.
- solicit buy-in for controversial features before investing too much effort.

These also applies if you truly are working as a one-man team. There are always avenue to incoporate the feedback of others, and they do not even need to be engineers.

**Build Feedback Loops for Your Decision**

Validation should be built into decisions made at all levels of management, not just technical decisions. Even if you cannot test a decision rigorously like an A/B test, you can still put validation to practice.

- formulate a hypothesis about what might work.
- design an experiment to test it.
- understand what good and bad outcomes look like.
- run the experiment.
- learn from the result.
- make adjustments.

For more radical changes, perhaps a thought experiment amd soliciting feedback from others would suffice.

### Improve Your Project Estimation Skills
Based on a study done in 2009, out of 50,000 software projects survey, 44% are delivered late, overbudgeted or missing requirements.

**Use Accurate Estimate to Drive Project Planning**

In general, use effort estimate to plan project timeline, instead of setting deadline first then cramp your development effort. When target date is impossible, the only way is to either scale back on deliverables or push back the deadline, to avoid a disaster.

To produce better estimates:

- Decompose the project into granular tasks. this prevents hidden tasks from creeping up.
- Estimate how long a task will take objectively, casting all agendas aside.
- Estimates are probability distributions, not best-case scenarios. provide most probable outcome, not most ideal outcome.
- The person executing the task should provide the estimates.
- Beware of anchoring bias. avoid giving initial guesstimate and committing to the number without outlining the tasks.
- Use multiple approaches to estimate the same task for more confidence. based on tasks, based on empirical data, based on number of systems etc.
- Beware the mythical man-month. number of persons assigned to the task and time spent are not interchangeable, hence be very careful using man-day metrics.
- Use timeboxing to constraint tasks that can grow in scope. examples are research and evaluation, set a hard deadline and force a decision within a time box.
- Allow others to challenge the estimates.
- iteratively improve the estimate. measure the actual effort and time taken, estimates can be refined to be more accurate as the project progresses, and reflect on making better estimates in future.

**Budget for the Unknown**
